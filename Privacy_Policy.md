# Privacy Policy

Akash P James built the SMS to YNAB app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Akash P James at no cost and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at SMS to YNAB unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to SMS. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you. For instance, the SMS will be safe in your device. But the messages that you wish to parse and send to YNAB will have access to your parsed message. What should be send to YNAB from your message solely decide upon the configuration you make while generating the template. And only those messages containing the trigger phrase will be parsed. Trigger phrase is provided by the user at the time of template generation.

## Log Data

I haven't provided the provision to report a bug. Hence, none of your log data will be collected by me.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

## Service Providers
I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

 - To facilitate our Service;
 - To provide the Service on our behalf;

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
Only one third party is involved here and that is YNAB. The information that you chose to share with the help of messages will be sent to YNAB's server. This helps you to see bank transactions in your YNAB budget account.

## Security

This app doesn't collect any Personal Information. Although, this app requires a Personal Access Token provided by YNAB, that information will be used to collect budget details and account details. The collected information will be safe in the user's mobile device. None of the information will be shared with any of the third-parties including me. The information collected will reside in the device only.

##  Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. There are two links in this app. One is a link to the help video which is uploaded in the Youtube and the other one is the link to YNAB's website to get your Personal Access Token. It is also to be noted that you don't have to visit these links from the mobile app and you are free to visit them from your device of choice and browser.

## Children’s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
